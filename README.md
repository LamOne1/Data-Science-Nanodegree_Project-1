# Installations
You need to install Python3 and the following packages (it's recommended to use Anaconda):

- tqdm
- numpy
- plotly
- seaborn
- matplotlib

Also, I recommend you to use Jupyter notebook to run the code.
# Project Motivation

Riyadh city, The capital of Saudi Arabia, has shown a noticeable growth in restaurants and coffee shops over the last years, as Eating out and shopping are considered one of the main entertainments activities in the city.
In this project, I'm trying to explore a dataset of Riyadh's restaurants and answering three questions:

**1- What is the most common category of restaurants in Riyadh?**

**2- How do restaurant prices bary across different regions of Riyadh?**

**3- What's the most correlated variable to the restaurant rating?**

# File Descriptions

The jupyter notebook file answers the questions above. It provides the dataset descriptions and the preprocessing steps. It shows how the questions are answered and visualization of the results.

# Results
You can find the results in this [blog](https://medium.com/@lamyamoib/an-overview-of-foursquare-data-of-riyadh-restaurants-ed82db277d9b), with visuals and descriptions.
