# Project Motivation

Riyadh city, The capital of Saudia Arabia, has shown a noticable growth in restaurants and coffee shops in the last years, as Eating out and shopping are consirered one of the main entertainments activities in the city.
In this project, I'm trying to explore a dataset of Riyadh's restaurants and answering three questions:

**1- What are the most common categories of restaurants in Riyadh?**

**2- How do restaurant prices change across different regions of Riyadh?**

**3- What's the most correlated variable to restaurant rating?**

# File Descriptions

The jupyter notebook file answers the questions above. It provides the dataset descriptions and the preprocessing steps. It shows how the questions are answered and visualization of the results.

# Results
You can find the results in the this blog, with visuals and discriptions.
